# foodly

**foodly** is a web application built using *PHP and AJAX* primarily for ordering food online.
It also provides separate interfaces for different types of users involved in the food delivery process.
Think of it as a platform connecting **customers** wanting food, **restaurants** preparing it, and **riders** delivering it, with specific tools tailored for each **user role**.
